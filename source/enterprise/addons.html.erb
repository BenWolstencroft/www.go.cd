            The GoCD Enterprise Analytics Plugin provides actionable insights about your release workflow, pipeline
            status and infrastruture utilization. You can easily identify and remove bottlenecks and optimize resources
            for best throughput by getting answers to questions like:

          <ul class="enterprise-addons-keypoints">
            <li class="left-align-text"> How long do pipelines take? </li>
            <li class="left-align-text"> How quickly do we recover from failures? </li>
            <li class="left-align-text"> Which jobs are slowest? </li>
            <li class="left-align-text"> Do we need to add more resources? </li>

        <h2 class="text-center mobile-section-title"> PostgreSQL</h2>
        <p class="justified-content">
          GoCD uses an embedded database by default. That's great for getting started. But, if you need to scale
          beyond a few teams and several pipelines, our PostgreSQL add-on gives you the performance upgrade necessary
          for hundreds of pipelines and agents. We recommend PostgreSQL for critical deployments.

        <h2 class="text-center mobile-section-title"> Business Continuity</h2>
        <p class="justified-content">
          Hard drives fail. This add-on helps ensure you can deliver even when your machine is down. With business
          continuity, youâ€™ll be able to set up secondary GoCD and PostgreSQL servers to protect against downtime.
          Automatic redirection of build agents and the ability to store artifacts on network drives is supported.

          This Elastic Agent Plugin for Amazon EC2 Container Service gives you the flexibility to autoscale your builds
          on docker instances running on an ECS cluster. It tailors your use of EC2 instances (with support for Docker
          containers) specific to your needs, by taking care of creating agents &amp; scheduling builds while monitoring the
          ECS cluster, allowing you to optimize your utilization and reduce costs.

          relevant access to your teams by leveraging your organizations' predefined roles within LDAP/AD. Manage users
          and roles centrally (LDAP), while using GoCD to define and maintain application specific role based access.
